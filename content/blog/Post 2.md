Post 2: Digital Minimalism in a Noisy World
We’re surrounded by endless content and constant noise.
Notifications scream for attention 24/7.
But most of it doesn’t serve us.

Digital minimalism is about reclaiming focus.
It’s choosing intentional use over mindless scrolling.
It’s about quality, not quantity.

Start by decluttering your digital space.
Unfollow, unsubscribe, uninstall what distracts.
A clean feed is a peaceful mind.

Check your screen time honestly and often.
What apps are adding real value?
Be ruthless in cutting the rest.

Silence creates room for reflection and growth.
A quieter phone means a louder mind.
Control the tech—don’t let it control you.
